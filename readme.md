## Introduction

This project contains 51Degrees Device Detection engines that can be used with the Pipeline API.

The Pipeline is a generic web request intelligence and data processing solution with the ability to add a range of 51Degrees and/or custom plug ins (Engines)

This git repository uses submodules, to clone the git repository run:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-python.git
```

or if already cloned run the following to obtain all sub modules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Dependencies

For runtime dependencies, see our [dependencies](http://51degrees.com/documentation/_info__dependencies.html) page.
The [tested versions](https://51degrees.com/documentation/_info__tested_versions.html) page shows 
the Python versions that we currently test against. The software may run fine against other versions, 
but additional caution should be applied.

### Data

The API can either use our cloud service to get its data or it can use a local (on-premise) copy of the data.

#### Cloud

You will require a [resource key](https://51degrees.com/documentation/_info__resource_keys.html)
to use the Cloud API. You can create resource keys using our 
[configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com/), see our 
[documentation](https://51degrees.com/documentation/_concepts__configurator.html) on how to use this.

#### On-Premise

In order to perform device detection on-premise, you will need to use a 51Degrees data file. 
This repository includes a free, 'lite' file in the 'device-detection-data' sub-module that has a 
significantly reduced set of properties. To obtain a file with a more complete set of device 
properties see the [51Degrees website](https://51degrees.com/pricing). If you want to use the lite 
file, you will need to install [GitLFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/):

```
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

Then, navigate to 'src/fiftyone_devicedetection_onpremise/cxx/device-detection-data' and execute:

```
git lfs pull
```

## Folders

* `fiftyone_devicedetection` - references both cloud and on-premise packages, contains generic Device-Detection Pipeline Builder.
  * `examples` - examples for switching between cloud and on-premise.
* `fiftyone_devicedetection_cloud` - cloud implementation of the engines.
  * `tests` - tests for the cloud engine and examples.
* `fiftyone_devicedetection_onpremise` - uses a native library which is built during setup to provide optimal performance and low latency device detections.
  * `tests` - tests for the on-premise engine.
* `fiftyone_devicedetection_shared` - common components used by the cloud and on-premise packages.
* `fiftyone_devicedetection_examples` - cloud and on-premise examples.
  * `tests` - tests for the examples.

## Installation

### PyPi

To install all packages, run:

```bash
python -m pip install fiftyone-devicedetection
```

The `fiftyone-devicedetection` package references both cloud and on-premise packages. If you do 
not want the on-premise engine or cannot meet the requirements for installing on-premise then 
install the cloud package on its own:

```bash
python -m pip install fiftyone-devicedetection-cloud
```
or
```bash
python -m pip install fiftyone-devicedetection-onpremise
```

See the [cloud](fiftyone_devicedetection_cloud/readme.md) and 
[onpremise](fiftyone_devicedetection_onpremise/readme.md) package readmes for more detail.

### Build from Source

Device detection on-premise uses a native binary. (i.e. compiled from C code to target a specific 
platform/architecture) This section explains how to build this binary.

#### Pre-requisites

- Install C build tools:
  - Windows:
    - You will need either Visual Studio 2019 or the [C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) installed.
      - Minimum platform toolset version is `v142`
      - Minimum Windows SDK version is `10.0.18362.0`
  - Linux/MacOS:
    - `sudo apt-get install g++ make libatomic1`
- If you have not already done so, pull the git submodules that contain the native code:
  - `git submodule update --init --recursive`

#### Build steps

It is recommended to use Pipenv when building packages. Pipenv will ensure all the required packages 
for building and testing are available e.g. `cython` and `flask`.

```bash
python -m pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

We use `make` to manage the build process. There are several targets for the make process. 
If unsure, you probably want to use the `install` target: 

```bash
make install
```

other make targets:

* `cloud` - only setup packages required for cloud
* `onpremise` - only setup packages required for onpremise
* `test` - run package tests
* `clean` - remove temporary files created when building extensions

Make can be installed on Windows. Alternatively, there is also a powershell setup script called 
`setup.ps1`. To run it, you may need to update the execution policy to allow unsigned scripts to 
execute:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Bypass

.\setup.ps1
```

Finally, if the make or powershell scripts fail, or you want to perform the steps manually for 
some other reason, these are the commands to build the native on-premise library and install 
the packages.

```bash
python -m pip install -e fiftyone_devicedetection_shared/
python -m pip install -e fiftyone_devicedetection_cloud/
cd fiftyone_devicedetection_onpremise/
python setup.py build_clib build_ext
cd ../
python -m pip install -e fiftyone_devicedetection_onpremise/
python -m pip install -e fiftyone_devicedetection/
```

## Examples

### Prerequisites
Please install the pre-requisites listed above as well as the examples themselves as a package:
```bash
python -m pip install -e fiftyone_devicedetection_examples/
python -m pip install -e fiftyone_devicedetection_shared/
```

### Running examples
To run an example - run a corresponding Python module specifying its full namespace.  
For cloud examples please provide a `resource_key` as an environment variable, f.e.:

```bash
resource_key=<your_resource_key> python -m fiftyone_devicedetection_examples.cloud.gettingstarted_console
```

For some of the onpremise examples you might need to provide a `license_key` as an environment variable, f.e.:
```bash
license_key=<your_license_key> python -m fiftyone_devicedetection_examples.onpremise.datafileupdate_console
```

```bash
python -m fiftyone_devicedetection_examples.cloud.gettingstarted_console
```

Please see a full list of provided cloud and onpremise examples below.
