# Required PyPi Dependencies:

# - flask
# 
# ## Overview
# 
# The `DeviceDetectionPipelineBuilder` class is used to create a Pipeline instance from the configuration
# that is supplied.
# The fiftyone_pipeline_core.web module contains helpers which deal with
# automatically populating evidence from a web request.
# ```{py}
# flowdata.evidence.add_from_dict(webevidence(request))
# ```

# The module can also handling setting response headers (e.g. Accept-CH for User-Agent 
# Client Hints) and serving requests for client-side JavaScript and JSON resources.
# ```{py}
# set_response_header(flowdata, response)
# ```
# 
# The results of detection can be accessed by through the flowdata object once
# processed. This can then be used to interrogate the data.
# ```{py}
# flowdata.process()
# device = flowdata.device
# hardware_vendor = device.hardwarevendor
# ```
# 
# Results can also be accessed in client-side code by using the `fod` object. See the 
# [JavaScriptBuilderElementBuilder](https://51degrees.com/pipeline-python/4.3/classpipeline-python_1_1fiftyone__pipeline__core_1_1fiftyone__pipeline__core_1_1javascriptbuilde778a9036818b19ab55d981a40be4a4d7.html)
# for details on available settings such as changing the `fod` name.
# ```{js}
# window.onload = function () {
#     fod.complete(function(data) {
#         var hardwareName = data.device.hardwarename;
#         alert(hardwareName.join(", "));
#     }
